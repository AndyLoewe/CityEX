# CityEx
Python project I did during my master thesis. 
The aim is to detect buildings and trees with the help of 3D laserscanner data. The
functions and algorithems desinged for this thesis are combined into one handy Python Tool which is presented here. 

# Packages you need
The programm rely on the following packages:
- os
- sys
- PyQt4
- json
- scipy with ndimage
- numpy 
- osgeo in general (gdal + ogr) 
- gdalconst


# Issues
As this is an old project it might still have some flaws (most cerntainly) and thus could make some problems. I will update it in future if I find time to do so.
